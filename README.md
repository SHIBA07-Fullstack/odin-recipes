This is the first project form Odin Project I have done. It has a basic html webpage structure of main index page and few of favorite food recipe pages linked to it. i have put into this project  the knowledge i gained from basic html foundation course of the Odin Project. I have demonstrated the core knowledge of the foundation course which includes html basic boilerplate, linking webpages, adding images, lists and paragraphs etc.

PS: Pardon my English!

Thank You,
